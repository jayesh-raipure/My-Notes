/**************************** Vim Editor Basics *********************************/
## 1) Open a file using vim ##
 >> vim file_name.txt
################################

## 2) Basic modes of vim ##
>> Vim has four modes: Normal, Insert, Visual, and Command. 
>> Each mode shows it’s name at the bottom left of the status bar in the program.
>> When you start vim, its in Normal mode. 
>> By using a, A, i, I, o and O you can inter into insert mode. Esc key takes user from insert mode.
>> v, V and ctrl+v used to go into visual mode.
>> : used to go into command mode.

## 3) Saving the file ##
>> In normal mode you can save and exit using ZZ.
>> You can also save the file with :w!. The : will put you into Command Mode, the w will write the file, 
   and the ! forces the operation to write without questions. 
>> Or, you can type :wq or :wq!. The q quits the editor. 
>> You can also use :q! to quit without saving.

## 4) Basic Cursor Movements ##
>> In Normal mode, you move around the file and make specific edits to the file. 
>> The h key moves the cursor to the left.
>> The l key moves the cursor to the right. 
>> The j key moves the cursor down a line, while the k key moves the cursor up a line.
>> To move to the next word, use the w command. 
>> The previous word command is b.
>> If you want to move more than one space, word, or line at a time, type a number first and then the direction key.
>> By using the Command mode, you can switch the line numbering to absolute or relative:
  >> 1.Absolute numbering mode is the normal: each line with a unique number in sequential order. 
    >> To have absolute line numbering, you can use the :set number command. To not show line numbers, 
       you use the :set nonumber command.
  >> 2. Relative numbering mode shows the number of lines away from the current edit line.
    >> To set Relative numbering, type :set relativenumber. To put it back to Absolute numbering, type :set norelativenumber.

## 5) The .vimrc File ##
>> The .vimrc file is Vim’s configuration file. Any command you type in command mode can be added to this file. 
   It will be ran every time Vim is started.
   
## 6) Search and Replace ##
>> You can search by using the / command in Normal mode. By typing /This, you will see all of the This words highlighted as below.
>> By typing n, your cursor goes to the next occurrence of the search pattern. By using N, you can go back to a previous occurrence.
>> In order to replace text, you have to make use of Command mode.
>> In Command mode, the s command is for substitution in the current line, %s for substitution in the whole file, 
   and <begin>,<end>s for substituting from <begin> line number to the <end> line number.
>> The format is /<search pattern>/<replace pattern>/gi where the <search pattern> and the <replace pattern> are standard regular expressions. 
>> An I would make the search case sensitive. The g makes the substitution global in the line

## 7) Copy, Cut, and Paste ##
>> When you press v in Normal mode, Visual mode begins. All cursor movements cause a selection from the beginning of Visual mode. 
>> When you have a selection, using the y command yanks or copies the selected text. 
>> Move to a new location and use the p command to paste after the cursor, while the P command pastes before the cursor.
>> After making a selection, the x command will delete the selection. 
>> Using the d command will cut the section so you can paste with the p command.
>> In order to select a block of text, you start with the <ctrl>-v command. 
>> The V command starts Visual mode selecting by lines and not characters.
